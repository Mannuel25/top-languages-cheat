# Introduction to Regular Expression

<b>Hello and welcome to Regular Expression cheat-sheet. We are going to be covering a lot in this tutorial but I would be doing this using regex in python for example, this really has nothing to do with any form of language, Regex is independent.</b>

## Firstly what is Regular Expression?

Have you heard of REGEX before? You should have known what that is, but if you don't, no problem.

Regex and Regular Expression means same thing, regex is just a shortened name for **REG**ular **EX**pression. In python, this is a powerful library that reads through files, looking for patterns and extracting
various bits of lines as intended. Regular expressions are almost their own little programming language for searching
and parsing strings.
